# A Survey on Self-driving Databases

##### Databases that take over functions from the Database administrators such as tuning, index selection, improve performance, etc.

You need to focus on Database aspects of these topics as at times they relate to other areas of Computer Science as well. The database aspects are included but not limited to **storage, indexing, index selection, query processing, efficient joins, query operations, reduction factor/selectivity/cardinality estimation, transaction management, query planning, database reliability, concurrency, etc**. You can pick 2-3 database aspects of your topic and go deeper on those aspects (for compare, categorisation, contrast, etc.).



### Structure

- Identification info for students/title/abstract/etc (1 cover page)
- Introduction to the Topic Area (1 page) ✔
- Related Work Details (papers covered explained in brief in some structured manner, categorisation, how a paper extended an approach from a previous paper, etc.) (6 pages)
- Comparison of Key Approaches/Papers (benefits and disadvantages from various aspects, when some approach is more applicable than other, etc.) (2 pages) [Note: This part can be presented combinedly with related work]
- Conclusions/Discussions and Future Directions (1.5 pages)
- Group reflection (0.5 page) [details below] ✔
- Individual reflection (maximum 200 words per student in the group) [details below]
- References (1 page)



Top conferences that you can find papers from on these topics in Databases are SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE, SIGKDD, SIGIR, SIGSPATIAL, ICDM among others. There are also top journals we can recommend, TKDE, VLDBJ, ACM TODS. Other top tier publication venues are also acceptable.

About **15 papers** are generally enough to cover the basics of an area (not including other surveys), but this number is not a hard requirement for the project. There are numerous conference and journal rankings you can check for venue rankings in computer science. You also need to cover recent publications. As particular requirement, you need to cite **at least 2 recent publications** (published on or after 2021).



**Group reflection:** For each group report, a group reflection needs to be included (only one per report) of approximately 0.5 page. Each group reflection should answer the following questions:

* As a team, how did you work on finding the reading materials for this survey?
* How did you decide which references to include in your survey?
* After completing this group project, if your team is asked to write another survey on a different topic, would you do something differently to find the reading materials? Why or why not?



**Individual reflection:** In each group report, each student from the group needs to include maximum **200 words** on their individual reflection, clearly marked with their name and student ID. Each individual reflection should include:

* What are the references of this report that you were responsible for (simply mentioning the reference numbers is sufficient)?
* If you were allowed to pick only one paper from those references (the ones that you were responsible for) to include in the report, which reference would you choose, and why?



### Format

The report should be in **A4 size, 11-point Times New Roman font, single column, main text with 1.5 line spacing with 1-inch margins**. The report should **not exceed 16 pages (but also no less than 10 pages) including everything**. Figures and Table(s) (e.g., for comparing methods) is highly recommended and crucial in some cases. Text that describes methods is important to understand the algorithms. Indicative number of words is 3500 words (excluding references), but may vary based on the informative tables and figures.



### Presentation (15%)	19/07/2023 (Wednesday) 1:35-2:00 PM

Structure of the presentation should follow the report as well, i.e., in terms of the key sections it involves. You do not need to include group or individual reflection in your presentation. The presentations will be allocated **no more than 25 mins** per group including questions and setup time etc. Thus, we recommend no more than **14-18 slides** for presentations.

The presentation file needs to be submitted before your presentation in Canvas->Assignments->B. Group project presentation as a ppt, pptx, or pdf file by only one member from the group.



### Submission (25%)

The deadline of this project is **July 24, 2023 11:59 pm**. Late submissions will get a penalty of 10% per day. The report must be submitted as a PDF file on LMS->Assignments->C. Group project report. Handwritten reports are not accepted in any form. The report should be submitted by only one person in your group, but all students’ IDs should be visible in the cover page.
